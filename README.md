# Redis-Database-Application
Technologies used: Java, SpringBoot, Redis.

- Redis is being used as a database in this application, it helps in reducing server loads.
  
To start the project in your local:

-Start Redis at port 6379 and keep the server running during entire duration.

-Go to main folder in Intellij/Eclipse and run the application as a SpringBoot Application.

-Perform the CRUD applications as usual through postman, they will be handled by Redis database here.

Thanks.
